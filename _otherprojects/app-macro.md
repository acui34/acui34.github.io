## Overview

Thanks to [Dr.Jessica Roberts](http://jessicaannroberts.com/) and [Marti Louw](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/marti-louw) at CMU Learning Media Design Center, I'm honored to be involved in this amazing project (bug alert!) - [macroinvertebrates.org](http://macroinvertebrates.org) from October 2018 to August 2020.

Meanwhile, I participated in many parts of the project, as a software engineer and/or a data analyst. The main milestones include:

* Interactive Dichotomous Key
* Macro.org Mobile App v1.0 (React Native)
* Macro.org Mobile App v2.0 (Flutter)
* Macro.org Mobile App v3.0 (Swift)
* Learning Pattern Mining and Visualization with Website Log

## Publication
Cui, C., Hill, J., Louw, M., and Roberts, J. (Under review). Using Log Visualizations to Interpret Online Interactions during Self-Quizzing Practice for Taxonomic Identification

## Interactive Dichotomous Key

* Built an [interactive dichotomous key](http://macroinvertebrates.org/key/) for macroinvertebrate identification
* Collaborated with scientists and designers to interate on interaction design for UX improvement
* Performed multiple rounds of interviews with users to test usability and collect feedback
* Used JavaScript and HTML

## Macro.org Mobile App v1.0 & v2.0 
* Designed and implemented a cross-platform offline-first mobile application with React Native (v1.0) and
Flutter (v2.0) to allow users to easily identify macroinvertebrates in outdoor environments.
* Re-designed and developed the project site’s database to satisfy mobile needs and saved 5GB+ memory

## Macro.org Mobile App v3.0 (Swift)
* Served as the lead developer in a team of 2 for the development of the project's mobile app
* Led system architecture design and weekly dev planning
* Deployed the app to Testflight for beta testing

The app is still under beta testing and is expected to be released this fall. Please refer to this [Blog](https://seetolearn.weebly.com/project-blog) to see works we've done.

## Log Data Mining and Visualization
Project information can be found in [this post](../data-projects/log-data-mining-visualization).

<!-- **Obviously,** we’ve styled up *all the basic* text formatting options [available in markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”

The theme also supports markdown tables:

| Item                 | Author        | Supports tables? | Price |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Duet Jekyll Theme    | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Index Jekyll Theme   | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Journal Jekyll Theme | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |

And footnotes[^1], which link to explanations[^2] at the bottom of the page[^3].

[^1]: Beautiful modern, minimal theme design.
[^2]: Powerful features to show off your work.
[^3]: Maintained and supported by the theme developer.

You can throw in some horizontal rules too:

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.

### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/148003889" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Pretty cool, huh?

We've packed this theme with powerful features to show off your work.

Why not put them to use on your new portfolio?
